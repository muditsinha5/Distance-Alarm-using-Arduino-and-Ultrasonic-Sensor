# Distance-Alarm-using-Arduino-and-Ultrasonic-Sensor
This project is based on Arduino UNO. Distance Alarm is a project that gives us a signal about the particular range of distance. In order to create Distance Alarm we have interfaced an ultrasonic sensor. 
We can see application of this project in parking sensors of cars where the distance alarm warns the driver that some object is present.
In this projct we have used 
Arduino UNO BOARD
LED
Buzzer
Ultrasonic Sensor
